3. Information We Collect
We collect information described below to save you time and money and to make your shopping experience better. We have grouped the information we collect into categories, with some of the information listed in multiple categories. Because we only collect information when needed for a particular purpose, not all this information will apply to you:

Personal identifiers such as name, online identifiers like user account names, state and federal government ID numbers, date of birth, signature, and unique identifiers that we associate with you. In some cases, we may scan your driver’s license to verify you are old enough to make a restricted purchase. If we scan your license for this purpose, we do not retain your drivers’ license number after we verify your age.
Contact information such as your email, postal address, billing address, delivery or shipping address, and phone numbers.
Health-related information.
To provide requested services to you or with your prior consent, we may collect health-related information in connection with certain consumer programs (e.g., wellness coaching or nutritional counseling, when we are not acting as a covered entity) and consumer research studies.
If you are injured in one of our stores, we may collect health-related information from you related to that incident.
Where permitted by applicable law, to serve you better we may make certain inferences about you based upon your shopping history that are health related.
If you are a pharmacy customer or a customer of one of other health-related operations like The Little Clinic, we may collect “Protected Health Information” (PHI) that is protected by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Our collection and use of PHI is not covered by this notice. For information about where you can learn more, see below in the section titled Protected Health Information.
Financial and payment information such as credit, debit, or other payment card numbers.
Transaction and commercial information such as your purchase and transaction histories. With respect to individuals who interact with us in a business context, we may have commercial information about our relationship with you.
Account information including your loyalty program membership information, household’s unique ID numbers (including username, Loyalty ID, and Alternate IDs); username, password, security questions; purchase information, coupons and savings information, fuel points, address information, preferred store, email and text communication preferences including your communication preferences relating to orders, marketing, and other activities; your advertising preferences.
Online and technical information such as your IP address and device or other persistent identifiers, browser type and version, time zone setting, device characteristics, browsing data, data related to your viewing of (and interactions with) our advertisements, website and app usage information, and other information that we collect using cookies, pixels, SDKs, and other similar technologies.
Location data including precise geolocation information.
Usage information including information about how you use our websites, mobile applications, and other service offerings.
Communication preferences including your preferences in receiving marketing and purchase-based advertising.
Sensory data such as CCTV recordings from our facilities or premises or photos. Some of our cameras may capture license plate data for
security purposes, to protect the health and safety of our customers and associates, and to prevent, investigate, and prosecute
shoplifting, fraud, and other criminal activities. We may record your voice when you contact our customer service centers.
General demographic information such as age, marital or family status (including whether your family includes children), languages spoken, education information, gender, employment information, or other demographic information. In addition, when permitted by applicable law, we may collect (or make inferences about) ethnicity or race.
Biometric information (in select locations only) such as a facial recognition data, when you enter our stores for security purposes, to protect the health and safety of our customers and associates, and to prevent, investigate, and prosecute shoplifting, fraud, and other criminal activities. We provide notice at the point of entry in locations where we collect biometric information.
User content including product reviews and other feedback or content you may provide to us.
Professional or employment-related information, such as your profession, job title, employer name, professional or licensure status, or other organizations to which you belong or are affiliated.
Inferences include information derived from other information that we have collected. We create inferred and derived data elements by analyzing your shopping history in combination with other information we have collected about you to personalize product offerings, your shopping experience, marketing messages and promotional offers.
Some of the information about you may include personal information that can be used to identify you, like name, address, and email address. In certain states, the definition of personal information may be broader and include things like IP address, mobile device ID, and unique identifiers used by cookies. When the information we collect about you is considered personal information under applicable law, we treat it as personal information.

Personal information does not include data where your identity has been removed so that we can no longer identify you or that we aggregate so that you can no longer be identified, which we may use for any purpose.

Children’s Privacy
Our websites are for a general audience and are not geared toward children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 16. If you believe your child may have disclosed personal information to us, please call 1-800-KROGERS (1-800- 576-4377) and we will remove it.

4. How We Collect Your Information
The following are examples of how we may collect your information:

In some locations, we may have cameras capable of collecting biometric information. We provide notice at point of entry in those stores.

Information from your device

We may collect information from a device that we have associated with you or your household. For example, we may collect information automatically when you browse our websites, use our mobile apps or other online services, or view or interact with our advertisements. If you choose to connect to our in-store wireless service, we may collect information about your device so you can automatically be connected. If you have opted-in to location-based services in our mobile app, we may show marketing-related push notifications when you are in one of our stores.

Information we collect from other companies within The Kroger Family of Companies

We may collect your information from another company in the Kroger Family of Companies.

We receive it from others

We may receive personal information about you from others including, for example, data analytics providers, data enrichment providers, ad networks, and consumer research providers. We may also receive information about you from commercially available sources such as data aggregators and public databases.

If you create an account with us using your Google account or another third-party account, we may receive certain information about you from Google or another third party to enable us to create your account.

In some cases, we may receive personal information about you from 84.51 LLC’s clients. When we receive this information, we use it only as necessary to provide the services that our clients have requested that we perform on their behalf.

Finally, from time to time, we receive information from others that has been deidentified so that it is no longer personal information under applicable law. When we receive deidentified data from others, we commit to maintaining and using that data in deidentified form without attempting to reidentify it.

For business analytics purposes, such as understanding the number of people who visit a webpage or view specific content within a webpage
To improve our websites and services
To detect and prevent fraud
To verify system and server integrity
-Embedded Scripts

We may use embedded scripts that collect information about your interactions with our websites, mobile apps, and advertisements. These scripts are temporarily loaded into your web browser and are active only while you are connected to our website, mobile app, or advertisement.

-Location-Identifying Technologies

We may use GPS (Global Positioning Systems), beacons, or other location identifying technologies to locate your device for various notified purposes, such as having your order ready for pickup when you arrive at our store or to serve you timely advertisements.

-In-App Tracking Technologies

Our mobile applications may use in-app tracking technologies including code from packages referred to as software development kits
(SDKs). SDKs are packages of tools that help our mobile apps function in some way.

For example, we may use code from SDKs in our mobile apps to:

Develop our apps to work with certain operating systems or platforms
Provide you an in-app map
Personalize advertising
Like with cookies, in many cases the data collected through these SDKs is controlled by us, but in some cases the data collected through use
of these SDKS is controlled by our vendors or other third parties.

Unlike cookies, SDKs and other in-app tracking technologies are not browser based and therefore cannot be controlled through browser
settings.

-Device and Activity Monitoring Technologies

We may use technologies that monitor and record your experience and interactions with our websites and mobile apps, such as the features you engage with, how you navigate our websites and mobile apps, your keystrokes, cursor movements, scrolling activity, and click-related activity. These technologies may also collect and analyze information from your device, such as your operating system, plug-ins, and system fonts.

Examples of why we may monitor your experiences and interactions include:

To troubleshoot
To understand and improve our websites, mobile apps, and services
To customize your experience
To respond to your inquiries and requests
To detect and prevent fraud
To detect security incidents and other malicious activity
To verify system and server integrity
Third-Party Interactive Features

We may engage vendors to provide certain interactive features on our website. Your use of these interactive features on our website is
voluntary, and we may retain the information that you submit through these features. For example, we may offer an interactive chat
feature on the website to assist you with your order and other customer service purposes. When you participate in the interactive chat, the
contents of the chat may be captured and kept as a transcript. By using these features, our vendors may process the information obtained
through the feature to provide the service on our behalf.

Third-Party Analytics

We may use third-party analytics providers to help us analyze how you use or interact with our websites, services, advertisements, and mobile applications.

Many of our websites and apps use Google Analytics. You can learn more about how Google Analytics collects and processes data at “How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services” and in the Google Privacy Policy. Information about Google Analytics’ current opt-outs for web is available here.

In some cases, we may integrate the analytics services we use with certain advertising services that are also made available by our analytics providers. For example, we integrate Google Analytics with the following Google advertising features:

Remarketing with Google Analytics
Cross Device Remarketing & Reporting
Google Analytics Demographics & Interest Reporting
Google Display Network Impression Reporting
You can opt-out of Google Analytics advertising features directly with Google through its Ads Settings, Ad Settings for mobile apps functionality, and through the NAI’s consumer opt-out mechanism available here.

8. Interest-Based Advertising
Interest based advertising (also known as online behavioral advertising) occurs when advertisements are displayed to you based on information collected from your online interactions over time and across multiple websites that you visit, or across multiple devices or online services that you may use. Companies that engage in interest-based advertising use this information to predict your preferences and show you ads that are most likely to be of interest to you.

Some of the content, applications, and tracking technologies on our websites and mobile applications is controlled by third parties, which include ad tech companies (such as Meta or Google) or other online service providers that serve interest-based advertisements. These third parties may use cookies (both first-party and third-party), web beacons, and other storage technologies to collect or receive information from our websites, apps, and elsewhere on the Internet and use that information to provide measurement services as well as for interest-based advertising. Data collected or received by these third parties may be used to provide advertising related services to us or others.

These third parties may provide you with ways to choose not to have your information collected or used in this way.

For example, you can block the collection and use of information related to you by online platforms and ad tech companies for the purpose of serving interest-based advertising by visiting the following websites of the self-regulatory programs of which those companies are members:

The NAI’s opt-out page is available here.
The DAA’s opt-out page is available here.
You may still see “contextual” ads even if you opt out of interest-based ads. These ads, however, are based on the context of what you are looking at on the websites and pages you visit. Even if you opt out of interest-based ads you will still receive these non-personalized, contextual ads.
